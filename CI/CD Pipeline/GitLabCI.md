# 1. Crash Course on CICD concept
## What is CICD
- CI/CD is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of software development
- We try to automate every possible stage of a software development cycle to minimize human intervention, thus, minimize the risk of errors
- Ci/CD makes the building and deploying of software easier, even a developer can make a code change live in prod
- CI/CD is a practice, set of operating principles that needs to be adopted in work culture

## CICD terms Unwrapped
- CI: Countinous Integration
   - Start: Adopting countinous integration practice is the first move towards delivering a high-quality software
   - Requires: requires developers to integrate their code into a central shared code repo, such as git, multiple times a day
   - Automation: Each check-in in the main code is verified by automated builds and tests that runs on some CI server
   - Goal:
      - Find and address bugs quickly
      - Improve software quality
      - Reduce the time it takes to validate and release new software updates

- CD: Countinous Delivery
 - Goal: A deployment-ready build software that hass passed through a standardized test process
 - Automated Releases: Artifacts produced by CI server are deployed to the test or staging server with just a singe click
 - Fast Deliveries: Build, Test and Release software with greater speed and frequency
 - Visibility: Makes it possible to continuosly adapt software in line with user feedback

- CD: Countinous Deployment
   - Final: Final stage of automating software development process
   - Automated Deployment: Softwares are deployed frequently in the end market through automated deployment systems
 
- Countinous Delivery vs Countinous Deployment: in Countinous Delivery although software holds potential to get release, but doing so would require approval and intervention of human

## 3.Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
- SDLC: a systematic process used by software industry for building the high-quality software

- Planning --> Defining --> Designing --> Building --> Testing --> Deployment 


## 4. Conventional SDLC approach (without CICD)
## 5. Drawbacks of Conventional SDLC approach
## 6. Adapting CICD work culture
- Test --> Build --> Deliver --> Release

# 2. Getting Started with GitLab

## 1. What is GitLab
- a web-based complete DevOps platform, that spans the entire software development lidecycle and helps teams to accelerate DevOps adoption
- Enables professionals to perform all tasks in a project - project planning, source code management, monitoring and security
- Gitlab is not a monolithic application; it believes a software module should do only one particular thing, and do it well.
- Provides a Git-repository manager for issue-tracking, CI & CD
- Supports both public and private development branches with gree and paid options
- Is updated every 22-nd day of month

## 2. Create first Project
## 3. GitLab UI Tour
## 4. Virtual Machine Installation


# 3. Create First Pipeline

## 1. Setting up Git Branches - Part 1
- ``` $ git branch ``` --> shows branches. green one is currenytly checked in
- ``` $ git branch <BRANCH_NAME> ``` --> create new branch, not check in to new branch
- ``` $ git checkout <BRANCH_NAME> ``` --> navigate to another branch

## 2. Setting up Git Branches - Part 2
- ``` $ git status ``` --> show status
- ``` $ git add <FILE_NAME> ``` --> add file to staging area, to include in next commit
- ``` $ git commit -m "COMMIT_MESSAGE" ``` --> commit locally
- ``` $ git push ``` --> push changes

## 3. What is Pipeline
- Pipelines are the top-level component of countinous integration, delivery and deployment
- Pipeline comprises of two things: Jobs & Stages
   - Job: defines what to do. EX: A job to test the code
   - Stage: Collection of jobs, It defines the order of jobs 
- If all jobs in a stage succeed, the pipelinemoves on the next stage.
- If any job in a stage fails, the next stage is not (usually) executed and the pipeline ends early
- Pipelines are executed automatically and requires no intervention once created.
- GitLab also allows you to manually interact with a pipeline
- Four usual stages of CI/CD pipeline:
1. Test
2. Build
3. Stage
4. Prod

- Multi types of pipeline can be build:
1. Basic Pipeline
2. DAG Pipeline
3. Parent-Child Pipeline
4. Multi-project Pipeline
5. etc

## 4. Write First Pipeline
Prerequisits:
1. App Code must be in a repo
2. Define .gitlab-ci.yml file in root of repo

File: 3- Simple Pipeline > .gitlab-ci.yml
## 5. Pipeline Execution Logs Explained
