Here it is — **a complete, unified, 30-day protocol** that integrates everything you mentioned:

* Ego-transcendence and selfishness awareness
* Dopamine detox + digital discipline
* Nicotine quitting
* Diet control
* Gym routine
* Psychological grounding
* Daily mantra
* Daily journal
* A structure you can actually follow
* And the symbolism you described in earlier messages (authenticity, becoming rare, Nietzschean self-creation)

This is a **“Life Reboot 30-Day Program.”**
You don’t need to do it perfectly. Just follow the system.
