# Session 1
- Monitoring consists of: Data collection - Problem detection - alerting
- Monitoring vs log collection : Log collection is mostly data collection only
- MTTR: mean time to recover
- MTTF: Mean time to failures
- MTBF: Mean time between failures
- Availabilty = (MTTF/MTTR)*100

# Session 2

# Session 3
- Zabbix DB consists of two sets of Tables in DB: History and Trend
- History: cconsisted of 5 tables, save exact data 
- Trend:

- Active Zabbix Proxy: sends data automatically to server. Better for complex situations where server can't see proxy due to firewalls. If your Network is open, this option is better 
- Passive Zabbix Proxy: Server have to request proxy to send data in response. Better for complex situations where proxy can't see server due to firewalls


- BSS : Business support system: CRM - Recommendation system - Billing
- OSS: Operation support system: 

# Session 4
- Zabbix agent developed using C
- Zabbix agent 2 developed using Go
- In any given zabbix stack, there is only one active zabbix server
- Metric collection categorization:
1. whether it is white box or black box: in black box you have a generally limited access to metrics but in white box you have detailed information inside system
2- whether it is pushing (active/trapping/event based) or pulling (passive): in pulling monitoring server requests to desired server to get its metrics, in pushing monitoring server does not requests to desired server and desired server send its metrics to monitoring server
- in monitoring log files, you need to use zabbix agnet in active mode, since it is evet-based 
- Zabbix features:
1. Metric Collection:
- Custom zabbix Metric Collection:
1. Zabbix Trapper: Script is on host, whenever/however it executed the response is be sent to zabbix server 
2. External Check: Script is on zabbix server/proxy, whenever/however it need to be executed is uppon zabbix server/proxy 
3. Script: Is using Java script, it is on zabbix server/proxy whenever/however it need to be executed is uppon zabbix server/proxy

- Monitored numeric data has differnet forms:
1. Cummulative: like age, machine kilometer, number of all services from firs day --> this metric won't reduce it is whether constant or adds up. Each time you monitor this it is related to last time. It is not good for operation monitoring so we derivative/Slope (ŸÖÿ¥ÿ™ŸÇ/ÿ¥€åÿ® ÿÆÿ∑) it
2. Gauge: current speed of car, Memory usage -- > Each time you monitor this it is not related to last time

- Monitoring is usually based on time-series, meaning that it can be mapped into a x-y axis with x axis being time and y axis being value of metric
