A:
The error you're encountering indicates that the Zabbix server is attempting to perform an automatic database upgrade during startup, but it's failing due to a conflict with an existing column in the database schema. Specifically, the error states that the column `name_upper` already exists in the `hosts` table, which is causing the database upgrade process to fail.

### Root Cause

This issue often occurs when the database schema has already been partially upgraded or when a previous upgrade was interrupted. Zabbix is trying to apply a schema change that has already been partially applied (i.e., the column `name_upper` already exists), leading to a conflict during the upgrade process.

### Steps to Fix

You have a couple of options to resolve this issue, depending on your current setup and how comfortable you are with modifying the database directly.

#### Option 1: Manually Resolve the Database Conflict

1. **Connect to the PostgreSQL Database**:
   - Use the following command to access your PostgreSQL container:
     ```bash
     docker exec -it pgsql-dev psql -U zabbix -d zabbix_db
     ```

2. **Check the Hosts Table**:
   - Run the following SQL command to check the structure of the `hosts` table:
     ```sql
     \d hosts
     ```

   - Confirm that the `name_upper` column already exists in the table. If it does, it confirms the upgrade was partially applied.

3. **Manually Complete the Upgrade**:
   - You can attempt to manually skip the problematic upgrade step by commenting out or removing the specific line from the upgrade script. However, this is risky and not generally recommended unless you're very familiar with Zabbix database schemas.

4. **Remove the Column (if Safe)**:
   - If you're confident that the column is a result of a failed upgrade and you want to retry the upgrade process, you can drop the column:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE hosts DROP COLUMN name_upper;
     ```

   - After that, restart the Zabbix container and let the upgrade process run again.

#### Option 2: Restore from a Backup and Retry the Upgrade

If you're not comfortable with manually resolving the issue in the database, the safest option might be to restore the database from a backup before the upgrade attempt and retry the upgrade process cleanly.

1. **Restore Database from Backup**:
   - Restore the database to the state before the upgrade process began.
   
2. **Restart the Zabbix Server**:
   - After restoring the database, restart the Zabbix server and let it perform the database upgrade cleanly.

3. **Verify the Upgrade**:
   - Monitor the logs to ensure that the upgrade completes successfully this time.

#### Option 3: Skip the Database Upgrade

If you do not wish to upgrade the database, you could use the previous Zabbix server version that matches your current database schema. However, this approach would limit your ability to use the new features and improvements in Zabbix 7.0.

1. **Switch to a Previous Zabbix Server Version**:
   - Modify your `docker-compose.yml` to use an older Zabbix version that matches your database schema, such as Zabbix 6.x.

2. **Start the Zabbix Server**:
   - Restart the Zabbix server using the previous version, and it should work without attempting to upgrade the database.

### Recommendation

The best approach depends on your situation:
- If the column `name_upper` was added by a previous failed upgrade, removing it and allowing the upgrade to continue is usually safe.
- If you prefer a cleaner solution and have a recent backup, restoring the database and retrying the upgrade process is a good option.

Q:
i dropped  column but still gets this;

     1:20241006:080053.312 [Z3005] query failed: [0] PGRES_FATAL_ERROR:ERROR:  column "name_upper" of relation "items" already exists
 [alter table items add name_upper varchar(255) default '' not null]
     1:20241006:080053.312 database upgrade failed on patch 06030069, exiting in 10 seconds

A:
The error message indicates that after dropping the `name_upper` column from the `hosts` table, the Zabbix server encountered a similar issue with the `items` table. The database upgrade script is trying to add a `name_upper` column to the `items` table, but the column already exists.

### Solution

The issue you're facing is likely a result of multiple partial upgrades, where several database schema changes were applied before the upgrade failed. You will need to apply a similar solution as before, but now for the `items` table.

### Steps to Fix

1. **Connect to PostgreSQL Database**:
   As before, connect to your PostgreSQL database container:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it pgsql-dev psql -U zabbix -d zabbix_db
   ```

2. **Inspect the `items` Table**:
   Check the structure of the `items` table to confirm that the `name_upper` column exists:
   ```sql
   \d items
   ```

3. **Drop the `name_upper` Column**:
   If the `name_upper` column exists, drop it as you did with the `hosts` table:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE items DROP COLUMN name_upper;
   ```

4. **Restart Zabbix Server**:
   After dropping the column, restart the Zabbix server and monitor the logs to see if the upgrade proceeds further.

   ```bash
   docker-compose restart zabbix-server
   ```

### Automating the Process for Other Tables

If the upgrade continues to fail on other tables with similar errors (i.e., `name_upper` column already exists), you can automate the process a bit:

1. **List All Tables with the `name_upper` Column**:
   Run this query to find all tables that already have the `name_upper` column:

   ```sql
   SELECT table_name
   FROM information_schema.columns
   WHERE column_name = 'name_upper';
   ```

2. **Drop the `name_upper` Column from All Tables**:
   You can then iterate over each table and drop the column using the appropriate `ALTER TABLE` statements.

3. **Monitor the Upgrade**:
   Continue monitoring the Zabbix logs. If the database upgrade script continues to encounter existing `name_upper` columns, you may need to repeat the process until the upgrade completes successfully.

### Verify Database Consistency

After successfully completing the upgrade, verify that the database is consistent by running the following commands within the Zabbix server container:

```bash
docker exec -it zabbix-server-pgsql zabbix_server -R config_cache_reload
```

This will reload the configuration cache and ensure that the Zabbix server is functioning properly with the upgraded schema.

### Preventive Measures

1. **Backup the Database**: Always take a backup of the database before attempting major upgrades to avoid having to drop columns manually.
   
2. **Upgrade in Stages**: When upgrading major versions, it's sometimes better to upgrade incrementally rather than skipping several versions at once. This can help prevent conflicts like this one.

A:
The error you're encountering indicates that Zabbix is trying to update the `hosts` table by setting the `name_upper` column, but the column doesn't exist in the database. This is likely due to a failed or incomplete database upgrade.

Here's what likely went wrong and how to fix it:

### Root Cause:
- During the Zabbix database upgrade process, a column (`name_upper`) was supposed to be added to the `hosts` table. However, it appears that the column was not added successfully, which is causing issues when Zabbix attempts to perform updates that rely on this column.

### Steps to Fix the Issue:

#### 1. **Verify the `hosts` Table Schema**:
   First, confirm that the `name_upper` column is indeed missing from the `hosts` table.

   Connect to the PostgreSQL database and inspect the `hosts` table:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it pgsql-dev psql -U zabbix -d zabbix_db
   ```

   Then, run the following command to check the table schema:
   ```sql
   \d hosts
   ```

   Look for the `name_upper` column in the output. If it doesn't exist, that confirms the issue.

#### 2. **Manually Add the `name_upper` Column**:
   If the `name_upper` column is missing, you can manually add it to the `hosts` table:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE hosts ADD COLUMN name_upper varchar(128) DEFAULT '' NOT NULL;
   ```

   This will add the missing column to the `hosts` table with the appropriate type and constraints.

#### 3. **Update the `name_upper` Column for Existing Data**:
   After adding the column, you will need to populate it with the appropriate data for the existing hosts:

   ```sql
   UPDATE hosts SET name_upper = UPPER(name);
   ```

   This will ensure that the `name_upper` column is correctly populated for all existing rows.

#### 4. **Re-test Host Updates in Zabbix**:
   After performing the above steps, try updating a host again within Zabbix to see if the issue is resolved.

#### 5. **Ensure Database Consistency**:
   If the manual steps resolve the issue, it’s a good idea to ensure that no other schema upgrades were skipped. You can review the Zabbix upgrade scripts (or logs) to verify that the database schema is fully up to date.

### Preventive Measures:
- **Backup Your Database**: Always make a full backup of your database before performing upgrades or any manual database changes.
- **Monitor Future Upgrades**: To avoid issues during future Zabbix upgrades, ensure that the upgrade process completes successfully, and monitor the logs for any errors during schema changes.

By adding the missing column and updating the data, Zabbix should be able to perform host updates without encountering the "column does not exist" error.
