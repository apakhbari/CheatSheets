## Module 1: Managing OpenShift Clusters

### 1-Understanding OpenShift Clusters

#### 1.1 Understanding the OpenShift Product Offering
- Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform extends Kubernetes with features commonly needed in the corporate datacenter
- Different OpenShift offerings exist
  - Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform: a platform that is managed by the customer to provide OpenShift service on physical or virtual infrastructure, on premise or in the cloud
  - Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated: a Red Hat managed cluster offered in AWS, GCP, Azure, or IBM cloud
  - Cloud-provider managed OpenShift solutions
  - Red Hat OpenShift Online: a Red Hat managed OpenShift infrastructure that is shared across multiple customers
  - Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes Engine: just Kubernetes and related features
  - Red Hat Code Ready Containers: a minimal OpenShift installation
  - OKD: the OpenShift open source upstream

#### 1.2 Understanding OpenShift Components
- **Control node** → runs all OpenShift services. It exists no matter if it's on cloud or on-premise. It runs CoreOS, and uses CRI-O as the container image. On top of CoreOS and CRI-O, there is Kubernetes (kube scheduler).
- **Compute nodes** → orchestrated by the control node. On version 4 and later, it is based on CoreOS, which is immutable. This means nothing can go wrong with it, it's container-like. It exists no matter if it's on cloud or on-premise. It uses CRI-O as the container image, and on top of CoreOS and CRI-O, there is Kubernetes (kubelet).
- **Web console**
- **oc**
- **Registry** → images → S2I
- **Monitoring**

#### Core Components
- CoreOS: the immutable operating system which is used as the OS foundation
- CRI-O: Open Container Initiative (OCI) compliant container runtime, used as the foundation to run containers
- Kubernetes: the open-source orchestration platform
- A web console
- Pre-installed application services such as an internal container image registry and monitoring framework
- Certified container images for programming languages, databases, and more

### OpenShift Features
- **High Availability**: core components are offered in a redundant HA setup
- **Load Balancing**: external load balancers are provided for access to the applications
- **Automatic Scaling**: number of replicas automatically scaled up or down when needed
- **Logging and Monitoring**: integrated Prometheus is used for gathering cluster metrics, and Elasticsearch is included for aggregated logging
- **Service Discovery**: based on an internal DNS service that auto-registers all applications
- **Storage**: provided by Kubernetes to offer access to many types of cloud, cluster, or local storage
- **Source To Image**: automatically builds and runs applications from source code
- **Application Catalog**: contains many runtime languages used in S2I, and can be extended by installing new operators
- **Operators**: ready-to-run added functionality that makes working with OpenShift easier
