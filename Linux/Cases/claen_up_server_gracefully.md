To safely clean up disk storage on an Ubuntu server with the ext4 file system, especially in a production environment where data loss is unacceptable, follow these steps carefully:
1. Check Disk Usage

Before proceeding with cleanup, identify which directories or files are consuming the most space:

bash

sudo du -h --max-depth=1 / | sort -hr | head -n 20

This will give you a quick overview of the largest directories in the root filesystem (/). Replace / with other directories if you want to inspect specific areas.
2. Remove Old Log Files

Logs can accumulate and take up significant space over time. You can remove old log files using logrotate or manually clean them up.

    Clean Up Logs Using journalctl (for systemd logs):

    bash

sudo journalctl --vacuum-size=500M

This will reduce the size of systemd logs to 500MB.

Manually Clear Logs:

You can remove or compress old logs in /var/log:

bash

    sudo find /var/log -type f -name "*.log" -exec truncate -s 0 {} \;

    This will clear all .log files in /var/log without deleting them.

3. Identify and Remove Orphaned Packages

Orphaned packages (unused packages left after uninstalling others) can take up unnecessary space. To remove them:

bash

sudo apt autoremove --purge

This command will remove unused packages and dependencies, along with their configuration files.
4. Clear the APT Cache

The APT package manager caches packages and keeps them in /var/cache/apt/archives. You can safely clean this cache:

bash

sudo apt clean

This removes all cached .deb packages in the APT cache directory.
5. Remove Old Kernels

On production servers, old Linux kernels can accumulate and take up significant disk space. To remove old kernels, first, ensure that you are running the latest stable kernel:

    List Installed Kernels:

    bash

dpkg --list | grep linux-image

Remove Old Kernels:

You can use the following command to automatically remove old kernels, but be careful not to remove the one currently in use:

bash

    sudo apt autoremove --purge

Ensure the current kernel is not being removed (check with uname -r to confirm which kernel you are currently running).
6. Clear Temporary Files

Temporary files can also accumulate in /tmp or user directories. You can safely clean these up:

    Remove Files in /tmp:

    bash

    sudo find /tmp -type f -atime +10 -delete

    This removes files in /tmp that havenâ€™t been accessed in the last 10 days.

7. Remove Unused Docker Images and Containers

If you're using Docker, old images, containers, and volumes can consume a lot of disk space. You can safely clean them up:

    Remove Stopped Containers:

    bash

docker container prune

Remove Unused Images:

bash

docker image prune -a

Remove Unused Volumes:

bash

    docker volume prune

8. Remove Old Snap Versions

If you are using snap, old versions of snaps can accumulate. Clean them up using:

bash

sudo snap set system refresh.retain=2
sudo snap remove --purge $(sudo snap list --all | awk '/disabled/{print $1, $3}')

This keeps only the last two versions of each snap package and removes the older, disabled versions.
9. Check for Large Files

Find large files that may no longer be needed. You can search for files larger than 1GB:

bash

sudo find / -type f -size +1G -exec ls -lh {} \;

Inspect the files and decide whether they can be removed or moved to another storage medium.
10. Analyze Disk Usage with ncdu

Install and use ncdu, a disk usage analyzer that gives you an interactive view of the largest directories and files:

bash

sudo apt install ncdu
sudo ncdu /

This will help you explore the file system and locate large directories or files that you might want to clean up.
11. Backup and Verify Critical Data

Before making any major changes, always ensure you have backups of critical data. You can use tools like rsync, tar, or your preferred backup solution to create a backup:

bash

rsync -av --progress /path/to/important/files /path/to/backup/location

Final Notes:

    Be careful when deleting files: Always double-check that files are not required by your system or applications before deleting them.
    Take regular backups: Implement regular backups to ensure that you have a way to recover your data in case anything goes wrong during cleanup.
    Monitor disk usage regularly: Set up monitoring tools like df or more sophisticated monitoring solutions (e.g., Nagios, Prometheus) to ensure that your disk space is consistently monitored in production.

This approach will help you clean up your disk storage while ensuring that your data remains safe.
