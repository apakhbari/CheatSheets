If your memory utilization is high, but the process usage in `htop` doesn't add up to the full memory, this is likely due to caching and buffering by the Linux kernel, which is normal for performance optimization. The Linux kernel uses free memory for cache to speed up future reads, but this memory is available to be freed up when applications require it. However, if you want to reduce memory usage or clear cache manually, you can do it gracefully as follows:

### 1. **Clear the Cache**
   - You can instruct the kernel to clear cached memory without affecting running applications:
     ```bash
     sudo sync; echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
     ```
   - Explanation:
     - `sync`: Writes data from memory to disk to prevent data loss.
     - `echo 3`: Frees page cache, dentries, and inodes (the cache for filesystem metadata).
   - This won’t cause issues, as the cache is cleared, not the data held by running processes.

### 2. **Check for Inactive Processes or Services**
   - Use `htop` or `ps aux --sort=-%mem` to check if there are services consuming memory unnecessarily. Stop or restart any inactive or unnecessary services gracefully.
   - For example:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart <service-name>
     ```

### 3. **Limit Swappiness**
   - Adjust the `swappiness` parameter to make Linux less aggressive in swapping:
     ```bash
     sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10
     ```
   - This will reduce swapping to disk and prioritize using RAM, especially useful if your server has limited memory.

### 4. **Check for Zombie Processes**
   - Sometimes, zombie processes (defunct processes that aren’t using memory but can still take up process slots) may cause higher resource usage. List zombie processes with:
     ```bash
     ps aux | grep 'Z'
     ```
   - Restart the parent service of any zombie processes to clean them up.

### 5. **Analyze and Reduce Memory Leaks**
   - If a particular application is steadily consuming more memory over time, it might be leaking memory. Restart that application periodically or investigate the code if possible.

### 6. **Disable Unnecessary Services**
   - Use `systemctl` to list services and disable any that are not needed:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl disable <service-name>
     ```

These steps can help you manage memory without impacting system performance significantly. Remember that Linux will release cached memory when required, so high cache memory usage doesn’t necessarily indicate a problem.
