## Directories

A standard format has been defined for the Linux virtual directory called the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS).

| Directory        | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `/`             | The root filesystem |
| `bin`          | Essential command binaries |
| `boot`         | Static files of the boot loader |
| `dev`          | Device files |
| `dev/mapper`   | Maps physical block devices to virtual block devices |
| `etc`          | Host-specific system configuration (editable text config files of system and applications) |
| `home`         | Home directory of the users (Contains user data files) |
| `lib`          | Essential shared libraries and kernel modules |
| `lib/module`   | Where modules can be found, individual hardware driver files that can be linked into the kernel at runtime |
| `media`        | Mount point for removable devices |
| `mnt`          | Mount point for mounting a filesystem temporarily (for removable devices) |
| `opt`          | Add-on application software packages (data for optional third-party programs) |
| `proc`         | Virtual directory kernel dynamically populates to provide access to information about the system hardware settings and status |
| `/proc/dma`    | Direct Memory Access channels send data from a hardware device directly to memory on the system, without having to wait for the CPU |
| `/proc/ioports` | Locations in memory where the CPU can send data to and receive data from the hardware device |
| `/proc/interrupts` | Assign each hardware device installed on the system a unique interrupt request address |
| `root`         | Home directory of the root user |
| `run`          | It is home to lots of **data used at runtime**. It is temporary |
| `sbin`         | Essential system binaries |
| `srv`          | Data for services provided by this system (`/srv/mysql` for saving database data) |
| `tmp`          | Temporary files created by system users |
| `usr`          | Secondary hierarchy (data for standard Linux programs) |
| `usr/bin`      | Local user programs and data |
| `usr/lib`      | Libraries for programming and software packages |
| `usr/local`    | Data for programs unique to the local installation |
| `usr/sbin`     | Data for system programs and data |
| `var`          | Variable data files, including system and application logs |
