To change the default IP pool of Docker (version 24.0.2, build cb74dfc) to the `10.10.0.0/16` range, you need to modify the Docker daemon's configuration file to specify a custom IP address range for Docker's network bridge.

Here are the steps to achieve this:

### 1. Edit the Docker Daemon Configuration File
Docker's configuration is typically managed via the `daemon.json` file located at `/etc/docker/daemon.json`.

1. Open the file in a text editor:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/docker/daemon.json
   ```

2. Add or modify the `"default-address-pools"` key to include your desired IP range:

   ```json
   {
     "default-address-pools": [
       {
         "base": "10.10.0.0/16",
         "size": 24
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   - `base`: This is the base IP address range for Docker networks.
   - `size`: This specifies the size of each network subnet that Docker will allocate from the pool. `24` is common because it allows for up to 256 addresses per network.

3. Save and close the file (`Ctrl + O`, then `Ctrl + X`).

### 2. Restart Docker

After modifying the `daemon.json` file, you need to restart the Docker service for the changes to take effect:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

### 3. Verify the Configuration

You can verify that Docker is using the new default IP address pool by inspecting a newly created Docker network:

```bash
docker network create test-network
docker network inspect test-network
```

Look for the IP range in the output under the `IPAM` section. It should show an IP range within `10.10.0.0/16`.

### Notes:

- Ensure that the IP range you choose does not conflict with your existing network setup.
- If you have existing containers or networks, they wonâ€™t be automatically reallocated to the new IP pool. You may need to recreate them if you want them to use the new IP range.
  
By following these steps, Docker will use `10.10.0.0/16` for the IP pool of its bridge networks going forward.
